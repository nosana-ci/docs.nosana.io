# Getting Started

## Welcome to the Nosana GPU Marketplace

The Nosana Network connects GPU Hosts with Clients who need scalable, cost-effective GPU compute. As a GPU Host, you’ll contribute to a decentralized ecosystem by listing your NVIDIA GPUs on the Nosana Marketplace for AI inference and other compute workloads.

## GPU Hosts

GPU Hosts run the Nosana Node software, which connects your hardware to the marketplace. To register your device, it must include a compatible NVIDIA GPU.

::: warning

We recommend running the Nosana Node software in a virtual environment and using a Solana wallet with only a minimal amount of SOL.

## Hardware Requirements

To participate as a GPU Host, ensure your setup meets the following criteria:

- **RAM**: 12GB+
- **Storage**: 256GB+ SSD

  Large language models storage requirements can be high, especially models geared towards higher end GPU’s. It is recommended that ancillary storage up to 1TB be provided for your host to handle client model requirements.
- **Bandwidth**: Minimum 100 Mb/s download, 50 Mb/s upload.

  High speed internet speed is required. To increase your chances of your host being hired by a client, we recommend 500 Mb/s download, 250 Mb/s upload, with ping below 100ms.
- **Supported NVIDIA GPUs**:

## Installation Guides

Follow these guides to become a GPU Host or list your hardware on the Nosana Network:

1. [Windows (WSL2)](/hosts/grid-windows): Learn how to list your hardware using Windows Subsystem for Linux 2, allowing Linux to run on your Windows machine.

2. [Ubuntu](/hosts/grid-ubuntu): Follow this guide if you're using Ubuntu, a widely used Linux distribution.

## Host Your GPU

After listing your hardware on the Nosana Network, you’re ready to start hosting! Launch your GPU Host to begin contributing compute power and earning rewards.
