# CI/CD recap

CI/CD introduces ongoing automation and continuous monitoring throughout the
lifecycle of apps, from integration and testing phases to delivery and deployment.
Taken together, these connected practices are often referred to as a "CI/CD pipeline"
and are supported by development and operations teams working together in an agile
way with either a DevOps or Site reliability engineering (SRE) approach.
