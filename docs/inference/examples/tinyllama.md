Tony was a tiny hawk who lived in the ocean. One day, Tony decided to go for a swim, so he swam to a new place. When he arrived, he saw a small plane with a hook on the top. It was wet and quite ugly. Tony was very curious, so he peeked inside.
He saw it had many different buttons and looked really exciting. Tony smiled, excited to explore. He decided to fly around and explore. He began to sing and dance. Suddenly, Tony heard a loud ringing noise and the plane started to slide down the pole. Tony was scared, but then he saw a group of people jumping in the air like the plane.
The people started laughing, and Tony got a bit embarrassed. But he had a lot of fun and decided to explore another part of the airport. He kept singing and dancing, and eventually he made it safely to the right floor. The passengers cheered when they saw Tony fly in the air.
Tony was proud of himself for seeing something so amazing! He knew that from now on he was never going to go exploring again.achieved tok/s: 129.610116
