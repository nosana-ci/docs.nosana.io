# How To Write A Job

## Overview

- **Nosana Jobs**: Each job on the Nosana network is essentially an AI inference task that runs from a Docker container. The jobs are designed to utilize GPU resources efficiently.
- **Nosana Nodes**: Jobs run on different Nosana nodes, which are represented as Solana addresses in the Nosana explorer. Each node contributes its GPU resources to execute the jobs.
- **GPU Markets**: Different types of GPUs available in the network are categorized into various markets. Each market supports specific job requirements based on the type of GPU.

## Execution Flow

These steps describe how submitting an inference job to the Nosana network.

1. **Job Submission**: A user submits a job defined in a JSON format. This job specifies the tasks to be executed, the Docker images to be used, and whether GPU resources are required.
2. **Node Selection**: The job is assigned to a Nosana node based on its requirements. The nodes are identified by their Solana addresses.
3. **Job Execution**: The selected node pulls the necessary Docker image and executes the commands specified in the job. For example, running AI inference tasks using the provided Python scripts.
4. **Resource Utilization**: Nodes utilize their GPU resources to run the tasks. This decentralized approach ensures efficient use of available hardware.
5. **Completion and Rewards**: Once the job is completed, the node may earn $NOS tokens as a reward for contributing its GPU resources.

## Examples

Nosana is a fully permissionless network, which means that whatever model you want to run in our network you can!
For examples you can take a look at the [Examples Catalog](../inference/examples/) or visit: [Nosana Templates](https://github.com/nosana-ci/pipeline-templates/tree/main/templates) on GitHub.
Some examples of which models you can run and links can be found in the following table:

### Nosana Inference example

You can explore the different jobs happening on the [Nosana Explorer](https://explorer.nosana.io/).
Here we can see an example of a Nosana inference job.
Note there are 2 `ops` (short for operations) happening in this inference job, both are using an [Ubuntu Docker Container](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu).

1. The first one is using the [nvidia-smi](https://developer.nvidia.com/system-management-interface) and other utilities to log hardware specifications of the Nosana node.
2. The second element in the `ops` array is using [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) to transcribe an audio file.

The `cmd` array is where we can input shell commands, we can specify the Docker `image` used, environment variables can be set using the `env` map, the GPU can be enable by setting the `gpu` value to true.
Read below for a full list of all of the properties you can set.

          // additional commands omitted for brevity
        ],
        "image": "docker.io/nosana/whisper:cuda-check",

      }
    }

## Job Schema Specification

Below we can see a list of the properties and a description for each property that can be set in a Nosana Jofor each property that can be set in a Nosana Job.

- **`version`**: Specifies Nosana compiler version.
- **`type`**: Indicates the type of job. Here, it's set to "container", meaning the job will run inside a Docker container.
- **`meta` (optional)**:
  - **`trigger`**: Defines how the job is triggered. In this example, it's set to "cli" (command-line interface).
- **`global` (optional)**: This a is a property to help define the properties of all of the operations defined in `ops`.

  - **`image`**: The Docker image to be used for the container.
  - **`gpu`**: A boolean indicating whether GPU resources are required.
  - **`entrypoint`**: An entry point in a container is a script or executable that specifies the command to be run when the container starts
  - **`env`**: Key value map for environment variables in the container.
  - **`work_dir`**: The working directory that will be selected for running commands.

- **`ops`**: An array of operations that the job will perform. Each operation includes:
  - **`type`**: Specifies the operation type. For instance, "container/run" indicates a containerized operation.
  - **`id`**: A unique identifier for the operation. Examples include "gpu-stats" and "run-whisper".
  - **`results`**(optional): - **`regex`**: Regex for parsing the result. - **`logType`**: The type of log for the result.
  - **`args`**: Arguments for the operation, which include:
    - **`image`**: The Docker image to be used for the container.
    - **`cmd`**: The command(s) to be executed in the container.
    - **`volumes` (optional)**: An array of objects containing a `name` and `dest` (destination) properties.
    - **`expose` (optional)**: A number representing an application port that needs to be exposed via the Nosana Service Endpoint.
    - **`gpu` (optional)**: A boolean indicating whether GPU resources are required.
    - **`work_dir` (optional)**: The working directory that will be selected for running commands.
    - **`output` (optional)**: Specify the output
    - **`entrypoint` (optional)**: An entry point in a container is a script or executable that specifies the command to be run when the container starts
    - **`env` (optional)**: Key value map for environment variables in the container.
    - **`resources` (optional)**: An array containing assets needed for inference.
      - **`type`**: String representing where the asset should be retrieved from, S3, HF (HuggingFace) or IPFS.
      - **`url`**: URL representing where the asset is located.
      - **`target`**: Location where the asset should be downloaded to.

### `cmd`

The `cmd` array is important to illustrate, because there are some nuances on how to use it.
If you are familiar with how to use the `cmd` property in Docker, you should already have an idea of how this property works.

There are two primary ways of using the `cmd` array.

1. String based CMD
2. Array based CMD

### String based CMD

When the first element of the array is the whole command, such as:
`"gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker main:app"`
Bash will be used as the shell to interpret this command.

### Array based CMD

Another option is to put each command and every flag as it's own element in an array:
`["/bin/sh", "-c", gunicorn", "-w", "4", "-k", "uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker", "main:app"]`

With the array based notation, we are able to specify the shell we want to use.
Note that most often you will need to append `-c` flag after `/bin/sh`

You can read more about how to use the `cmd` property by going to the [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#cmd).
