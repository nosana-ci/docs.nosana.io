## What is CI/CD ?

In software engineering, CI/CD is the combined practices of Continuous Integration (CI) and either 
Continuous Delivery or Continuous Deployment (CD).

CI/CD bridges the gaps between development and operation activities and teams by enforcing automation in building, 
testing and deployment of applications. 
Modern day DevOps practices involve continuous development, continuous testing, continuous integration, continuous 
deployment and continuous monitoring of software applications throughout its development life cycle. 

The CI/CD practice, or CI/CD pipeline, forms the backbone of modern day DevOps operations.

## A CI/CD pipeline

Below you'll find an example of a CI/CD pipeline where a code commit triggers a series of automated steps,
that can eventually lead the deployment of a new release of the software.

## Why CI/CD ?

CI/CD is used for a multiple or reasons in software development. 
At Nosana we focus on 3 main aspects. 
These are (i) speed, (ii) reliability, and (iii) growth.

Ongoing feedback allows developers to commit smaller changes more often, increases development velocity.
